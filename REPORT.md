# Festive Voice Project Report

## Overview

Festive Voice is an open-source project aimed at providing themed voice features for Python applications, with a focus on holidays and celebrations. The project seeks to make it easy for developers to add festive, audio-driven experiences to their software.

## Objectives

- Enable developers to deliver delightful, theme-based voice prompts and greetings.
- Create an extensible system to support multiple holidays and user-contributed audio assets.
- Foster community involvement and encourage collaboration.

## Architecture

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Structure**: Modular, supporting the addition of new festive themes.

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Scaffolded main Python module.
   - Outlined API for playing festive audio.

3. **Documentation**
   - Wrote comprehensive README, CONTRIBUTING, and CHANGELOG files.
   - Created templates for future documentation expansion.

## Future Work

- Implement actual audio playback features.
- Add sample festive audio assets.
- Expand tests and CI/CD integration.
- Grow the set of supported holidays and languages.

## Challenges

- Selecting appropriate open-source audio assets.
- Ensuring cross-platform audio compatibility.
